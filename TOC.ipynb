    "### Introduction and Motivations\n",
    "Table of Contents (TOCs) are a core method of **chunking** vast domains of knowledge and information. \n",
    "\n",
    "They aren't the only method (headings, topics, mind-maps, courses, stories and so on), but I hypothesise that they can be very effective. The structure of knowledge is of particular importance to those who must efficiently and effectively understand core concepts and for those who prefer to get a broad lay of the land, before jumping into more specific detail. It is also notable that every concept can be expanded – that is, anyone should theoretically be able to devote many lifetimes to the exploration of any subject, word, or even idea or concept imaginable, because every concept has infinite connections and we are finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The context of this lab, on the experiences of the author, is based on exploration and experimentation. He is mostly driven by personal motivations, overlayed by the desire to practice machine learning and AI in the context of the personal problem of learning about all fields as efficiently as possible, as a relative novice in the CS field and ML practice."

I would guess that a proportion of these are mostly older books, or they somehow slipped through the cracks of providing a TOC in the particular database in which I sourced the data. A quick look at the titles without TOCs bears no simple direct pattern, however, the presence of several religion topics (~ 1/3) might point to a similar author writing those volumes. For this analysis, these 30 volumes without TOCs will be excluded from the dataset to yield 707 total values."
